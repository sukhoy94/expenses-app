## About

The application expenses-app was created (and still is creating - you are free to join) with the purpose of giving simple functionality for tracking your everyday money expenses.
Terminology:

budget - amount of money you free to spend during the month
expenses - your everyday money expenses

So the idea is simple and quite I think useful: you define your budget, add each expense to application and see in each moment how much you spent, how much money remains and so on.
